We are a small team of researchers on applied artificial intelligence from the University of Málaga (Spain). The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in solving complex problems is becoming increasingly important. Our goal is to explore the potential of AI to try to solve some of the problems facing our world today.

Our main research interests are multiagent systems, agent-based modeling and simulation, multiagent (deep) reinforcement learning, and data science techniques applied to different fields such as smart cities, predictive policing, healthcare, education, environmental sustainability, logistics, and social governance.
